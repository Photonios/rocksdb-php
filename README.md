RocksDB PHP Extension
===
RocksDB is a new embedded database for storing key-value pairs developed by Facebook. This project hosts a PHP extension for RocksDB. More information on RocksDB can be found here:

https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb

###Simple Example
	<?php
		$rocksdb = new RocksDB("my_rocksdb_file");
		$result = $rocksdb->Open(true);
		if($result)
			die("Unable to open rocksdb!");
			
		$rocksdb->Put("my_awesome_key", "my_awesome_value");
		$value = $rocksdb->Get("my_awesome_key");
		
		echo $value . "\n";
	?>
	
Check `test/test.php` for more examples.

##Platforms
RocksDB is said to compile on Linux and Mac OS X. So far, I haven't seen anyone getting it to build on Windows, but it should work.
My build environment is:

* Ubuntu 13.10 x64
* GCC 4.8.1

All documentation, instructions and guides assume my configuration. If you were able to get it working on another platform, please let me know.

## Notes
I use a custom version of PHP-CPP, because I added basic exception support. Please checkout the fork, until my
pull request has been accepted:

	git clone https://github.com/Photonios/PHP-CPP

## Build
#### Building RocksDB PHP Extension
Before trying to build the RocksDB PHP extension, make sure you have installed all dependencies listed below. After that, you can simply checkout the code:

	git clone https://github.com/Photonios/rocksdb-php.git
	
Then, run make:

	make
	
The PHP extension, which is a shared/dynamiclly linked library can be found in the `bin` directory.

#### Building PHP
The RocksDB PHP extension is being written against PHP 5.5.3. To be able to build the RocksDB PHP extension, you need to install the following packages:

    sudo apt-get install php5-dev
    sudo apt-get install php5-cli

#### Building PHP-CPP
PHP-CPP is a C++ library which makes developing PHP extensions from C++ possible. It's also, way easier then using the native PHP C API. PHP-CPP can be found here:

https://github.com/EmielBruijntjes/PHP-CPP

To build, clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/EmielBruijntjes/PHP-CPP.git php-cpp

Go into the 'php-cpp' directory and run:

	make

After that, 'libphpcpp.so' should be present in the 'src' directory. To install the library, do one of the following thins:

* Add the path where you cloned PHP-CPP to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=/path/to/php-cpp/src`)
* Create a new file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` with the `.conf` extension, where the path to the PHP-CPP src directory is on a single line
* Copy the file `libphpcpp.so` to `/usr/lib`
    
#### Building RocksDB
To build the RocksDB PHP Extension, you first need to build RocksDB. Clone the RocksDB git repository using:

    git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git
  
To be able to build RocksDB, you first need to install all dependencies, this can be done using apt-get:

    sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
    sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
    sudo apt-get install libgflags2
    
Or run:

	sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libgflags2
    
After you've install all dependencies, you can simply run:

    make clean
    make
    
To build and run all unit tests:

    make check
    
To install the RocksDB library you can do either of these three things:

* Add the path where you cloned RocksDB to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=/path/to/rocksdb`)
* Create a new file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` with the `.conf` extension, where the path to RocksDB is on a single line
* Copy the file `librocksdb.a` to `/usr/lib`

Choose whatever you like :)

## Installation
After you build the RocksDB PHP extension, you should have a `.so` file in the `bin` directory. Execute:

	php --ini
	
To find out where your PHP configuration file is located. It should output something liek this:

	Loaded Configuration File:         /etc/php5/cli/php.ini

Find the line that starts with `extension=`, if it's commented out, uncomment it and set the path to your extension, like this:

	extension=/iam_awesome/cookies/dance/in/the/rain/rocksdb-php.so
	
Then, enjoy :D
